# Will be tested only with positive integers for for_seed and upper_bound,
# and a strictly positive integer for size.
#
# Exploration can follow up to 8 directions
# (two horizontally, two vertically, and four diagonally).
#
# Travelling from m to n means starting from a cell that stores m,
# moving to a (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) neighbouring
# cell that stores m + 1, then moving to a (horizontally, vertically
# or diagonally) neighbouring cell hat stores m + 2... and eventually
# reaching a cell that stores n.
#
# Most of the code is written already, and there are not many statements
# left for you to write...
